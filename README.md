# E. Forecast Data
[Forecasting systems](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/warning-and-forecasting-systems.html) calculate future atmospheric conditions on the basis of measurement data and observations. MeteoSwiss uses these weather models to create weather forecasts and to enable it to issue weather warnings in the event of imminent hazards.

The following forecast data are available:

1. [Short-term forecast data](#1-short-term-forecast-data) :yellow_circle: *documentation upcoming*
2. [Numerical weather forecasting model](#2-numerical-weather-forecasting-model) :yellow_circle: *documentation upcoming*
3. [Local forecast data](#3-local-forecast-data) :yellow_circle: *documentation upcoming*

## 1. Short-term forecast data
[Nowcasting](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/warning-and-forecasting-systems/nowcasting.html) involves high spatial and temporal resolution forecasts of weather developments for the next few minutes and up to a maximum of six hours ahead. MeteoSwiss uses these short-term forecasts to, among other things, predict thunderstorms, hail and heavy rainfall.

As MeteoSwiss is planning to replace the current 'INCA' nowcasting software, the following datasets are available from the start of our open data provision:
- **Precipitation (10min values): quantitative chain (based on CombiPrecip, RR)**
- **Wind, wind gust and wind direction (10min values)**
- *Relative sunshine duration* (10min values)
- **Total cloudiness (10min values)**

The following datsets will be provided next:
- **Snowfall (10min values): quantitative chain (based on CombiPrecip, RS)**
- ...
- ...

### 1.1. Data granularity, update frequency, format and volume
Data granularity is every 10min. Update frequency for the period 0h- +6h is specified per dataset in the table below.

## 2. Numerical weather forecasting model

MeteoSwiss uses two models, **ICON-CH1-EPS** and **ICON-CH2-EPS**, to forecast atmospheric changes in Switzerland and its surroundings over a longer period than nowcasting, providing predictions for up to five days. Both models include
[ensemble data assimilation](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/warning-and-forecasting-systems/icon-forecasting-systems/ensemble-data-assimilation.html).

### 2.2 Available Parameters

Users can find information about available parameters, including metadata, in the collections listed above.

#### 2.2.1 Parameter metadata

The parameter metadata is part of each GRIB file.


### 2.3 Accessing Forecast Data

The user can access the forecast model output data from the last 24 hours. Data older than 24 hours is no longer available. To check available data, the user can refer to the relevant collections listed in the table above.


### 2.4 3D grid structure and representation

The ICON model is an unstructured native grid. It distingiushes between a horizontal and vertical grid structure.
Combining the two structures results in a 3 dimensional grid over Switzerland and
its surroundings. We differentiate between single and multi level parameters where the
former describes a parameter on a single vertical level and the latter a parameter on
the entire 3-dimensional grid. For example the vertical velocity is stored in multiple vertical
levels, whereas the two-meter-temperature has only information in one vertical level.

#### 2.4.1 Vertical grid

The vertical grid is a height based coordinate system that follows the terrain. It is divided into multiple layers. The closer the layer is to
the surface, the narrower the layers are, as one can see in the picture below.
Note that the so-called *half levels* correspond to the horizontal grid points, while the *full levels* describe an avarges value
over the whole vertical layer. In total there exists 80 discrete half levels.

Illustration of ICON's vertical levels, Working with the ICON Model 2024, Figure 3.2
</div>

Be aware that some data is stored on half and some on full levels.
For example the vertical velocity W has its information on half levels, meaning that the value is exact in this point
and not an avarage value over an interval stored in one point. A parameter with this property is called staggered.
To check wheather a parameter is staggered, one needs to access the parameter metadata. For more
detailed information on the vertical grid, read section 3.4 in [Working with the ICON Model](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/nwv_icon_tutorial/pdf_einzelbaende/icon_tutorial2024.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3).

#### 2.4.2 Horizontal grid

The horizontal grid of ICON-CH1-EPS and ICON-CH2-EPS model is based on a native icosahedral grid inherited by the original ICON model grid (illustrated below).

<div align=center>
<img src="Images/IcosahedralGrid.png" width="300"/>

</div>

Since the provided data is given in the native grid, note that the grid points correspond to the **center of the circumcircle of each triangle** and **not** to the vertices. Therefore, the longitude and latitude are based in the middle of each triangle on the grid mentioned before. For more detailed information on
the horizontal grid, read section 2.1 in [Working with the ICON Model](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/nwv_icon_tutorial/pdf_einzelbaende/icon_tutorial2024.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3).
